TalliHash is designed to be a tag‑centric, polyhierarchical forum platform where, unlike on Reddit:

•	**Tags form communities:** posts live in multiple tags at once, eliminating crossposts.

•	**Transparency is default:** votes are shown as tallies (e.g. $${\textsf{\color{green}+12}}$$<sub>$$({\textsf{\color{green}20}\color{red}-8})$$</sub>), moderation actions are logged, and rules are community‑ratified.

•	**Governance is democratic:** admins maintain structure (tag creation, hierarchy), while communities set and evolve their own rules.

•	**Funding is user‑driven:** a one‑time sign‑up fee deters bots, and occasional donation drives sustain the commons—no ads, ever.
